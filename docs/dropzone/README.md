# 📥 dropzone

This is your tactical clipboard. A dumping ground for raw notes, copied SOPs, tech docs, and unformatted ops material.

Anything you want Tom or Git-Tom to rewrite, format, or organize? Drop it here first.

---

## How to Use

- Paste raw content from Word, PDFs, emails, or voice transcripts
- Keep each dump in a separate file
- Use this folder like a stack of clipboard scratch pads

---

## Cleanup Protocol

1. Drop file in here (`load_ops_dump_06_08.md`)
2. Call Tom:
   > “Hey Tom, convert `load_ops_dump_06_08.md` into a structured SOP”
3. Move the cleaned result to `/sops/`, `/docs/`, or wherever it belongs
