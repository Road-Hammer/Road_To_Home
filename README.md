The Bible says that; "A righteous man, will leave an inheritance to his childern's, childern!"

üìú Proverbs 13 ‚Äì Highlights, Verse by Verse (Condensed + Interpreted)

    ‚ÄúA wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.‚Äù
    ‚Üí If you‚Äôre smart, you shut up and listen. Fools run their mouths and ignore the people trying to save them.

    ‚ÄúFrom the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good...‚Äù
    ‚Üí Speak life, speak truth ‚Äî your words can either feed or starve you.

    ‚ÄúWhoever guards his mouth preserves his life...‚Äù
    ‚Üí Watch your tongue or it‚Äôll dig your grave.

    ‚ÄúThe soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing...‚Äù
    ‚Üí Lazy folks dream big but do nothing. The diligent? They get fed.

    ‚ÄúThe righteous hates falsehood...‚Äù
    ‚Üí If you walk right, lies make you sick. Crooked men drown in their own stink.

    ‚ÄúRighteousness guards him whose way is blameless...‚Äù
    ‚Üí Clean living acts like armor. Sinful behavior? It‚Äôs a trap.

    ‚ÄúOne pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.‚Äù
    ‚Üí Smoke and mirrors. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the shine or the struggle.

    ‚ÄúThe ransom of a man‚Äôs life is his wealth...‚Äù
    ‚Üí Money might buy you out of trouble, but the poor man doesn‚Äôt even show up on the radar.

    ‚ÄúThe light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.‚Äù
    ‚Üí God shines through the good; the wicked get snuffed.

    ‚ÄúBy insolence comes nothing but strife, but with those who take advice is wisdom.‚Äù
    ‚Üí Hard-headedness leads to fights. Wisdom listens.

‚öîÔ∏è Verses That Really Hit in This Season

    Verse 12: ‚ÄúHope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.‚Äù
    ‚Üí That waiting game breaks a man down, but when the thing you‚Äôve been fighting for finally lands ‚Äî it‚Äôs life-giving.

    Verse 20: ‚ÄúWhoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.‚Äù
    ‚Üí Your circle can bless you or burn you. Choose your people like your life depends on it ‚Äî because it does.

    Verse 22: ‚ÄúA good man leaves an inheritance to his children‚Äôs children‚Ä¶‚Äù
    ‚Üí You‚Äôre not just building for now. You‚Äôre laying foundation for the grandkids. Legacy is the long game.
