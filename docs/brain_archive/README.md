# ðŸ§  brain_archive

This folder stores legacy AI memory, planning sessions, operational logic, and tactical history from ChatGPT sessions.

It serves as Git-Tomâ€™s reference hub for structured memory that cannot persist in ChatGPT but must remain accessible in Codex and repo-based tools.

---

## How to Use

- Drop memory exports, SOP drafts, raw planning notes, or rewritten ChatGPT outputs here.
- Name files clearly (e.g., `trust_succession_logic.md`, `legacy_pipeline_notes.md`).
- Tom or Git-Tom can reference this folder to restore memory or logic context.

## Index (To Be Filled In)

- `trust_succession_logic.md` â€“ Succession and fallback tree
- `motor_pool_ops_v2.md` â€“ Updated fleet strategies
- `vault_rules_fortress.md` â€“ IP storage and non-compete doctrine

*This folder is read-heavy, write-light.*
