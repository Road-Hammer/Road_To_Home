# Ridgerunner Express

Welcome to the logistics wing of Road To Home. Ridgerunner Express hauls bulk 53' dry van loads at 80,000 pounds and beyondâ€”this is our core trucking operation. The hotshot division handles the lighter, time-critical runs. If you're looking for sugar-coated corporate fluff, you're in the wrong place.

## Mission
- Deliver fast, reliable transport across our lanes.
- Stay small, agile, and ready for anything.
- Integrate with our AI advisor **TOM-OPS-X** for dispatch and ops planning.

## Current Ops
- Phase 1 is live with regional runs.
- Expansion plans tie directly into **Road Hawk** analytics and **Fortress** security.
- SOPs, routing scripts, and maintenance logs will live here as they come online.

## How To Use This Folder
- Treat every file as part of an ops manual.
- Commit access is for cleared team members only.
- Check `../TOM_MODULE.md` and `../tom_brain.json` if you need a refresher on tone, protocol, or our "no BS" policy.

## Legal
- All intellectual property funnels through the Fortress entity.
- Drivers and contractors sign strict non-disclosure and gear policies.

Stay sharp, stay true. Ridgerunner Express doesn't slow down.
